## Research Datasets

### Dataset Description
This dataset contains anonymized information on Individual Data Processing (IDP, German: IDV) from 2023 to 2025 of german research institute under public governacne. All personal or security‑relevant fields — especially owners, substitutes, and storage locations — have been fully anonymized.
The dataset is published openly and freely to support research, teaching, and analytical tool development.

### Purpose of the Dataset
Individual Data Processing solutions are widely used within organizations to compensate for process gaps or improve inefficient workflows. Employees often create scripts, macros, or small custom applications — fast, flexible, and practical.
While these solutions increase efficiency, they also introduce risks, such as:
- Information security risks
- IT risk management challenges
- Compliance issues
- Data quality problems
- Lack of documentation and traceability
- Shadow IT

This dataset helps examine these risks and patterns in a structured way.

### Why This Dataset Matters
Despite their importance, IDP datasets are rarely available to the public, mainly due to confidentiality concerns. At the same time, their relevance is rapidly increasing in modern organizations.
This dataset aims to:

- Provide students with realistic data for projects and exercises
- Support researchers in IT security, IT risk management, and business security analytics
- Enable analysis of risks, patterns, and dependencies in IDP systems
- Support development of risk assessment models, automation tools, and monitoring concepts
- Fill the gap of missing training and benchmarking datasets in the IDP/IDV domain

### Contents
- Anonymized records of IDP entries (2023–2025)
- Information on categories, processes, tools, responsibilities, and more
- Machine-readable formats (CSV/JSON)
- Documentation of data fields and structure

### Use Cases
- Data mining & exploratory data analysis
- Risk assessment and scoring models
- Machine learning and clustering
- Security analytics research
- Teaching and academic coursework
- Modeling of shadow IT and IDP ecosystems

### License
The dataset is freely available and may be used for research, teaching, and personal projects under the provided license.
So feel free to use it and have fun with your research!
